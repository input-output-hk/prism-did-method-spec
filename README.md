## DID:PRISM Specification

This repository holds the [specification of the `prism` DID method](https://github.com/input-output-hk/prism-did-method-spec/blob/main/w3c-spec/PRISM-method.md), and defines data models and protocol rules to create, manage, and resolve Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) on top of the Cardano blockchain as its verifiable data registry, where DID's information is stored.

[Decentralized identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core) (DIDs) are a type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID refers to any subject (for example, a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, and so on) as determined by the controller of the DID.

The `prism` DID method is in constant evolution, and future versions are under development. It is recommended to any implementer to follow the evolution of the new versions closely to understand, comment on, and/or suggest future changes via issues and PRs.

### Extensions

The `prism` DID method serves as a building block for other protocols and applications. Refer to the [extensions folder](https://github.com/input-output-hk/prism-did-method-spec/tree/main/extensions) to find related specifications that build upon this DID method.
